# High Agency Traits by Vivian Shen

Everyone thinks that success is down to:

Hard work. Luck. Intelligence.

They're wrong.

After building 2 startups in Silicon Valley, I've seen one rare trait all successful founders have.

Here's what it is (and how you can build this rare trait too):

In 2017, I started my first company Juni - an online education company.

That has since raised $10.5M, backed by Y-Combinator.

And because of this, I have been around many successful founders.

The one trait I see in all of them? High agency.

Here's how to be more high agency:

---

## Develop a Bias for Action

High agency individuals don't wait for permission or perfect conditions.

They take initiative and start moving forward, even if the path isn't entirely clear.

They understand that progress beats perfection and that taking action creates opportunities.

## Embrace Discomfort

High agency requires stepping outside your comfort zone.

It means taking on challenges that stretch your abilities and tackling problems others shy away from.

Discomfort is a sign you're growing. Lean into it, and watch your capacity for agency expand.

## Take Ownership

High agency founders don't make excuses.

They take full responsibility for their choices, actions, and outcomes.

They see themselves as the primary driver of their success, and they own their failures as learning opportunities.

## Be Resourceful

High agency people are masters at making the most of what they have.

They find creative ways to leverage limited resources and turn constraints into advantages.

---

## Persist through Adversity

Setbacks, obstacles, and failures are all part of startup life.

What sets high agency founders apart is their ability to persist through adversity.

They view challenges as puzzles to solve, not roadblocks.

---

## Surround Yourself with Other High Agency Individuals

The people you surround yourself with have a profound impact on your own level of agency.

Seek out other driven, action-oriented individuals who will inspire you.

Build a network of high agency people.

Remember, high agency is a choice.

It's a way of showing up and approaching problems.

Out of all the successful people I've met,

High agency was a trait they all had.
